Deniers of Fate
Description
Deniers of Fate is a bullet hell space game developed during my specialization in Game Design at PUCRS. In this game, players control a spaceship, shoot targets and enemies, and leverage a unique time travel mechanic. This mechanic enables players to rewind gameplay a few seconds by using a slider bar, adding a strategic layer to the action-packed experience.
